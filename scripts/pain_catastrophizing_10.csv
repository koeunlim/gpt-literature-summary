Wells, ","""Pain catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression in hip pathology."", ",The bone & joint journal ,101-B(7) ,(Jul. 2019). ,PUBMED: 31256659; ,DOI 10.1302/0301-620X.101B7.BJJ-2018-1309.R1.,"Psychological factors play a critical role in patient presentation, satisfaction, and outcomes. Pain catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression are important to consider, as they are associated with poorer outcomes and are potentially modifiable. The aim of this study was to assess the level of pain catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression in patients with a range of hip pathology and to evaluate their relationship with patient-reported psychosocial and functional outcome measures."

Ickmans, ","""Brain changes associated with cognitive and emotional factors in chronic pain: A systematic review."", ","European journal of pain (London, England) ",21(5) ,(May. 2017). ,PUBMED: 28146315; ,DOI 10.1002/ejp.1003.,"An emerging technique in chronic pain research is MRI, which has led to the understanding that chronic pain patients display brain structure and function alterations. Many of these altered brain regions and networks are not just involved in pain processing, but also in other sensory and particularly cognitive tasks. Therefore, the next step is to investigate the relation between brain alterations and pain related cognitive and emotional factors. This review aims at providing an overview of the existing literature on this subject. Pubmed, Web of Science and Embase were searched for original research reports. Twenty eight eligible papers were included, with information on the association of brain alterations with pain catastrophizing, fear-avoidance, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Methodological quality of eligible papers was checked by two independent researchers. Evidence on the direction of these associations is inconclusive. Pain catastrophizing is related to brain areas involved in pain processing, attention to pain, emotion and motor activity, and to reduced top-down pain inhibition. In contrast to pain catastrophizing, evidence on anxiety and depressive symptoms shows no clear association with brain characteristics. However, all included cognitive or emotional factors showed significant associations with resting state fMRI data, providing that even at rest the brain reserves a certain activity for these pain-related factors. Brain changes associated with illness perceptions, pain attention, attitudes and beliefs seem to receive less attention in literature."

A patient's perception of a dental care experience as catastrophic can result not only in poor satisfaction with the therapy but also in avoidance of necessary treatments, resulting in the deterioration of oral health."

Journal canadien de chirurgie ,61(5) ,(Oct. 2018). ,PUBMED: 30246983; ,DOI 10.1503/cjs.015417.,"Catastrophizing, a coping style characterized by an exaggerated negative affect when experiencing or anticipating pain, is an important factor that adversely affects surgical outcomes. Various interventions have been attempted with the goal of reducing catastrophizing and, by extension, improving treatment outcomes. We performed a systematic review to determine whether catastrophizing can be altered in surgical patients and to present evidence for interventions aimed at reducing catastrophizing in this population."

A primary cognitive-behavioural framework is the Fear-Avoidance Model, which posits that pain catastrophizing and fear of pain (including avoidance, cognitions and physiological reactivity) are key antecedents to, and drivers of, pain intensity and disability, in addition to pain-related psychological distress. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the magnitude of the cross-sectional association between the primary components of the Fear-Avoidance Model (pain catastrophizing, fear of pain, pain vigilance) with negative affect, anxiety, depression, pain intensity and disabilities in studies of clinical pain."

More recently, injuries suffered by US service members in Iraq and Afghanistan have resulted in a high number of survivable conditions. Polytrauma care in this setting must take into account both the physical and psychological injuries suffered by returning wounded warriors. Catastrophizing may occur when previously healthy individuals are faced with impairment and disfigurement. This is compounded with repeated operative procedures. Early detection and treatment of catastrophizing contributes to improved care of the wounded warrior. This article describes our experiences at Walter Reed Army Medical Center with catastrophizing in US service members returning from the current military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan."
